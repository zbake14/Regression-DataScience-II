In this submission includes an excel file with the maximum r-squared, 
adjusted r-squared, and cross-validated r-squared, as well as each n* 
for each dataset and regression.

PowerPoint slides that summarize all of the results are include as well.


SCALATION
The right folder to run the scalation code is 

/Project1/Scala

To compile the code, first start an sbt server with the following command:

	$ sbt

Then to actaully compile the code run this command:

	sbt:hello> compile

Now to run the code, use this command:

	sbt:hello> run

Now the following text should appear:

	[warn] Multiple main classes detected.  Run 'show discoveredMainClasses' to see the list

	Multiple main classes detected, select one to run:

	[1] regression.LassoRegression
	[2] regression.LinRegress
	[3] regression.ResponseSurface
	[4] regression.RidgeRegression
	[5] regression.quadRegression
	[info] Packaging ...
	[info] Done packaging.
	Enter number: 

The number you enter will correspond to which regression will run,
so if you wanted to run RidgeRegression, you would type '4' and then 
hit enter.

Each of these files execute in the same way, they run the regression 
specified for each of the 10 datasets we selected. 
The datasets and links are below:
1. Auto MPG: https://archive.ics.uci.edu/ml/datasets/Auto+MPG 
2. Bike Sharing: https://archive.ics.uci.edu/ml/datasets/Bike+Sharing+Dataset
3. Computer Hardware: https://archive.ics.uci.edu/ml/datasets/Computer+Hardware
4. Concrete Compressive: https://archive.ics.uci.edu/ml/datasets/Concrete+Compressive+Strength
5. Electrical Grid Stability: https://archive.ics.uci.edu/ml/datasets/Electrical+Grid+Stability+Simulated+Data+
6. Energy Effeciency: https://archive.ics.uci.edu/ml/datasets/Energy+efficiency
7. Forest Fires: https://archive.ics.uci.edu/ml/datasets/Forest+Fires
8. Optical Interconnection: https://archive.ics.uci.edu/ml/datasets/Optical+Interconnection+Network+
9. Protein Tertiary: https://archive.ics.uci.edu/ml/datasets/Physicochemical+Properties+of+Protein+Tertiary+Structure
10. Wine Quality: https://archive.ics.uci.edu/ml/datasets/Wine+Quality

We read each of these datasets in as a csv file, and the code is in the 
corresponding scala file. For instance the Bike Sharing dataset is read 
in the BikeSharing.scala file and all the preprocessing is done there.

The regression files will each output a lot of text which is the
forward selection method. It will also print out the max 
r-squared, adj r-squared, and cross-validated r-squared, however,
it may be lost in all the forwardSel output.
Each dataset will also produce a plot of each of the 3 metrics vs. how 
many variables are included in the model.

So in summary each regression file runs 10 regressions for each of 
the 10 datasets and produces 10 plots. 


Notes:
Response Surface will take a while to run as the forward selection is 
running through (n+2)*(n+1)/2 columns.

In order to run the R code:
1. Open the MainRegression.R file
2. Change line 4 to whatever full pathname you have the Project1/R 
	folder in
3. Ensure that you have all the packages seen in lines 7-12
4. Run the code in its entirety.

The code will take approximately 5 minutes to run with just Linear
Regression, Ridge and Lasso Regression. 
Uncomment and run Quad and Response Surface at your own risk
It may crash the R session and you will have to start over
The code will not run with any dataset with more than 50 variables,
so it will most likely not work with Quad and Repsonse Surface, 
however all the functionality is there.
